Description:

Between generations 6 and 9, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo's video game consoles have consistently sold well in the market, with each company experiencing both successes and challenges. 

Microsoft's Xbox 360 was a commercial success, selling over 84 million units, while the Xbox One struggled to compete with the PlayStation 4, selling around 55-58 million units.
Sony's PlayStation 3 had a slow start but eventually sold over 87 million units, while the PlayStation 4 became the best-selling console of its generation, with over 115 million units sold. Nintendo's Wii was a massive hit, selling over 101 million units, and the Switch has also performed well, with over 144 million units sold as of Feb, 2023. 

These sales numbers indicate that each company has been able to find a market for its consoles, with the Wii's success showing that there is a demand for innovative and unique gaming experiences, and the continued popularity of the PlayStation 4 and Switch demonstrating the importance of a strong gaming library as well as cutting-edge graphics.

The top 3 best-selling video games across Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo's video game consoles between generations 6 and 9 are a testament to the popularity and influence of the gaming industry. Many of these games demonstrate the appeal of open-world, sandbox-style games, as well as the popularity of first-person shooters, and their sales numbers show the massive reach and impact of the gaming industry.

All sales data was sourced from VGSales, VGChartz, and Kaggle from each company's fiscal reports and was created and formatted by me via MySQL.
However, Microsoft never released to the public the yearly sales of the 8th generation, Xbox One between 2017 and 2022. Sony also stopped reporting yearly sales after 2012 for the PS3, though it has been reported that in 2022, 87.4 million units of PS3s had been sold.

Although this sort of data can never be truly accurate, the purpose of this project is to give a general picture of who was the victor in each generation's "Console Wars".
